Unfortunately, object-relational mapping frameworks make it easy to accidentally
write code that performs unsafe read-modify-write cycles instead of using atomic
operations provided by the database [38].

//commutative atomic operations,并发原子增量？
However, if there is enough spare capacity, and if contention between transactions is
not too high, optimistic concurrency control techniques tend to perform better than
pessimistic ones. Contention can be reduced with commutative atomic operations:
for example, if several transactions concurrently want to increment a counter, it
doesn’t matter in which order the increments are applied (as long as the counter isn’t
read in the same transaction), so the concurrent increments can all be applied
without conflicting.
