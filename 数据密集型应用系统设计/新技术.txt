PostgreSQL has optimizations for avoiding
index updates if different versions of the same object can fit on the same page
[31].

//仅追加与写时复制技术 
Another approach is used in CouchDB, Datomic, and LMDB. Although they also use
B-trees (see “B-Trees” on page 79), they use an append-only/copy-on-write variant
that does not overwrite pages of the tree when they are updated, but instead creates a
new copy of each modified page.Parent pages, up to the root of the tree, are copied
and updated to point to the new versions of their child pages. Any pages that are not
affected by a write do not need to be copied, and remain immutable [33, 34, 35].

operations for modifying data structures such as priority queues

Large datacenter networks are often based on IP and Ethernet, arranged in Clos
topologies to provide high bisection bandwidth [9]. Supercomputers often use
specialized network topologies, such as multi-dimensional meshes and toruses
[10], which yield better performance for HPC workloads with known communication
patterns.
