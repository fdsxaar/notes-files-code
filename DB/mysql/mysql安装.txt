1.Adding the MySQL Yum Repository
Once the MySQL Yum repository is enabled on your system, any system-wide update by the yum update command 
will upgrade MySQL packages on your system and also replace any native third-party packages, if Yum finds 
replacements for them in the MySQL Yum repository; see Chapter 3, Upgrading MySQL with the MySQL Yum Repository
 and, for a discussion on some possible effects of that on your system, see Upgrading the Shared Client Libraries.
