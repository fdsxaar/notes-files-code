func ResolveTCPAddr
//不推荐用host name
func ResolveTCPAddr(network, address string) (*TCPAddr, error)
If the host in the address parameter is not a literal IP address or the port is 
not a literal port number, ResolveTCPAddr resolves the address to an address of TCP 
end point. Otherwise, it parses the address as a pair of literal IP address and port number. 
The address parameter can use a host name, but this is not recommended, because it will return 
at most one of the host name's IP addresses.
