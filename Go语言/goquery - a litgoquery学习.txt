goquery学习
goquery - a little like that j-thing, only in Go

1.goquery 基于包net/html和cascadia。net/html 编译返回nodes，而不是DOM树
goquery brings a syntax and a set of features similar to jQuery to the Go language. 
It is based on Go's net/html package and the CSS Selector library cascadia. Since the 
net/html parser returns nodes, and not a full-featured DOM tree, jQuery's 
stateful manipulation functions (like height(), css(), detach()) have been left off.

# net/html parser需要UTF-8,goquery也是；调用者有责任确保HTML文件按UTF-8编码
Also, because the net/html parser requires UTF-8 encoding, so does goquery: 
it is the caller's responsibility to ensure that the source 
document provides UTF-8 encoded HTML. See the wiki for various options to do this.

语法以及函数名等尽量类似于jQuery

2.API
Document holds the root document node as the initial Selection value to manipulate.
#有一个选择器字符串
with a selector string argument is called XxxFiltered() (e.g.: PrevFiltered())
#需要一个参数，用于selector string version
 requires one argument, the same name as jQuery is used for the selector string version (e.g.: Is())
#接受一个*Selection object 
The signatures accepting a jQuery object as argument are defined in goquery as XxxSelection() 
and take a *Selection object as argument (e.g.: FilterSelection())
#接受可变参数，类型为*html.Node
XxxNodes() and take a variadic argument of type *html.Node (e.g.: FilterNodes())
#接受一个函数
XxxFunction() and take a function as argument (e.g.: FilterFunction())
#接受一个Matcher接口
 be called with a selector string have a corresponding version that take a Matcher interface
 and are defined as XxxMatcher() (e.g.: IsMatcher())
