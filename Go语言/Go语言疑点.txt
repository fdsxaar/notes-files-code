The var iable tracks below contains a playlist. (One of the authors ap olog izes for the other
author’s music al tastes.) Each element is indirec t, a pointer to a Track. Although the code
below would work if we stored the Tracks direc tly, the sort function will swap many pairs of

instead of an entire Track, which mig ht be eig ht words or more.

7.7 将函数值赋值给指针
mux.Handle("/list", http.HandlerFunc(db.list))

7.11. Discriminating Errors with Type Assertions

#两个不相同类型进行比较
return err == syscall.ENOENT || err == ErrNotExist
