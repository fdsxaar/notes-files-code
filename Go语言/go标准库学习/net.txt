Name Resolution：
解析方式依操作系统而定，

type Conn interface {
    //keep-alive failure故障可能返回timeout错误
    // Note that if a TCP connection has keep-alive turned on,
    // which is the default unless overridden by Dialer.KeepAlive
    // or ListenConfig.KeepAlive, then a keep-alive failure may
    // also return a timeout error. On Unix systems a keep-alive
    // failure on I/O can be detected using
    // errors.Is(err, syscall.ETIMEDOUT).
    SetDeadline(t time.Time) error

}


func Dial
func Dial(network, address string) (Conn, error)
两种形式的拨号：
For TCP and UDP networks, the address has the form "host:port"
Dial("tcp", "198.51.100.1:80")
Dial("udp", "[2001:db8::1]:domain")

For IP networks, the network must be "ip", "ip4" or "ip6" followed 
by a colon and a literal protocol number or a protocol name, and the address has the form "host"
Dial("ip4:1", "192.0.2.1")
Dial("ip6:ipv6-icmp", "2001:db8::1")

//address参数最好用ip地址
//The address parameter can use a host name, but this is not recommended,
// because it will return at most one of the host name's IP addresses
func ResolveTCPAddr
func ResolveTCPAddr(network, address string) (*TCPAddr, error)

//设定操作系统级别的缓冲
func (*TCPConn) SetReadBuffer
func (c *TCPConn) SetReadBuffer(bytes int) error
SetReadBuffer sets the size of the operating system's receive buffer associated with the connection.

//conn实现了read、write等方法，Conn接口有这些方法
type TCPConn struct {
	conn
}
